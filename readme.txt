 yea, i got lazy. But wasnt lazy enough to look for a good resource or two for these schematics. Some good resources Ihave 
 found are listed below.
 
 https://www.apple-schematic.se/
 https://www.ifixit.com
 https://www.microsoldering.com/iphone-and-ipad-schematics/
 
 All of these are owned by their rightful owner and through time, I will be transfering the files from the websites to this repository.
 Again, if you want to help transfering these files, please @ me or DM me on twitter and i will get back to you asap. Thank you for using 
 this repo and Apple, dont be an ass.
